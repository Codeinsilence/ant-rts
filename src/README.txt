To run the game
1) open project.godot
2) run the main scene (world.tscn)

NOTE:
When opening the project for the first time, you may encounter the following error/warning:

" scene/resources/resource_format_text.cpp:284 - res://scenes/worker.tscn:56 - Parse Error: 
  Failed loading resource: res://scenes/worker.tscn. Make sure resources have been imported by opening the project in the editor at least once. "

The game will still compile, but you will be unable to open worker.tscn

To remedy this, in the top-left of Godot, click Project->Reload Current Project

The error should not appear, and you should be allowed to open worker.tscn
